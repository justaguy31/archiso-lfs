Just a school project based on [Linux From Scratch](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/index.html).  

## How to build the ISO

Dependencies: [Archlinux](https://archlinux.org), [archiso](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/archiso/).
  
This is mostly a copy of /usr/share/archiso/configs/releng from package "archiso",  
therefore you can follow the Archlinux guide "[Archiso](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archiso)" and [archiso docs](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archiso/-/tree/master/docs?ref_type=heads) to configure and build the ISO.
