# archiso-lfs

Just a school project based on [Linux From Scratch](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/index.html) which may be a good Windows alternative for russians. Basically it's just a giant Bash script that installs Linux From Scratch with additions.  

## How to install

Gotta edit this later when the script is fully done  

## How to build the ISO

Dependencies: [archiso-persistent](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/archiso-persistent) or probably [archiso](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/archiso/) (needs testing)
  
This is mostly a copy of /usr/share/archiso/configs/baseline from [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) package "archiso-persistent",  
therefore you can follow the Archlinux guide "[Archiso](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archiso)" and [arch-persistent docs](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/tallero/archiso/-/tree/master/docs?ref_type=heads) to configure and build the ISO.
